## Push and asynchronous methods

### Push

Skyve provides developers methods to support pushing to the user conversation. Push can be useful for:
* notifying a user that a long running job is complete
* notifying user of another action occurring in the system which may impact on their current activity
* chaining another action to occur after an action is complete
* updating the current user view as a result of one of the above

Push methods | Description
-------------|------------
growl() | display a popup message to the user(s) 
message() |
rerender() | cause the current view to rerender
user() | limit push activity to a specified user
execute() | execute an action

For example, to notify the current user using a growl message that Task X has failed:

```java
User userToNotify = CORE.getUser();
EXT.push(new PushMessage().user(user).growl(MessageSeverity.error, "Task X has failed"));
```

![Example growl](../assets/images/push-and-asynchronous-methods/growl.png "Example growl")

In the above example, the `user()` method is used to limit the push to the specified user.

Note that for convenience, the `WebContext` also provide a `growl` method, for example:

```java
webContext.growl(MessageSeverity.info, SENT_SUCCESSFULLY_MESSAGE);
```

The `WebContext` `growl()` method will only provide a growl to the webContext, whereas `Ext.push` can provide a growl to all currently logged in users (or a specified user). 

#### Broadcast message

The Push methods can be used to broadcast messages to all current users, for example:

```java
Ext.push(new PushMessage().growl(MessageSeverity.warn, "System will be offline for maintenance in 5 minutes..."));
```

### Rerender considerations

When using the `rerender()` method for push actions, the developer needs to consider the impact this may have on the user, who may experience disruption - for example, if they are in the process of data entry.

However, this approach can be combined with the PrimeFaces remoteCommand tag for customised xhtml pages. 

Consider the use case of a simple team discussion/chat application.

```xhtml
<p:remoteCommand name="pushRerender" actionListener="#{skyve.rerender('push', false)}" process="@this" update="msgHistory" />

<s:view module="#{skyve.bizModuleParameter}"
			document="#{skyve.bizDocumentParameter}"
			managedBean="skyve" widgetId="topicHistory" id="msgHistory" />

<s:view module="#{skyve.bizModuleParameter}"
			document="#{skyve.bizDocumentParameter}"
			managedBean="skyve" widgetId="topicAdd" />
```

In the above extract, the customised view contains two view tags - each with a unique `widgetId` drawn from the view declaration in the document view `edit.xml`. The `remoteCommand` tag specifies that push messages will only `update` the component with id=`msgHistory`. This would allow the user to continue entering data in the `topicAdd` view component without disruption while the `topicHistory` section of the view is updated.

For a basic messaging application, where all users can view a common topic history of previous discussion items as they are added, the following action would post a message to the topic history and update the history of discussion items for all users.

```java
@Override
public ServerSideActionResult<Topic> execute(Topic bean, WebContext webContext) throws Exception {
	
	TopicMessage tm = TopicMessage.newInstance();
	tm.setTopic(bean);
	tm.setMessageText(bean.getNewMessage());
	tm.setPosted(new Timestamp());
	tm.setUser(ModulesUtil.currentAdminUser());
	
	CORE.getPersistence().upsertBeanTuple(tm);
	
	EXT.push(new PushMessage().rerender());

	return new ServerSideActionResult<>(bean); // stay on the same form
}
```

Note that the `Ext.push` method does not specify a user - and so is effectively a broadcast push to all user conversations.
