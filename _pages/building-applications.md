# Building Applications

### Skyve Readme

The skyve project contains a Readme at [github.com/skyvers/skyve](https://github.com/skyvers/skyve) with useful information for getting started, configuring Spring security and other steps to get you started.

## Creating a new Skyve project

### Before you start:
Install Eclipse or an alternative Java based Integrated Development Environment and an application server. Detailed instructions are available in the Skyve Readme at [github.com/skyvers/skyve](https://github.com/skyvers/skyve).

### Overview:
1. Use the Project Creator [https://foundry.skyve.org/foundry/project.xhtml](https://foundry.skyve.org/foundry/project.xhtml) to create a Skyve project download and receive the link to the file via email.
2. Import the project as a maven project and run the Generate Domain run configuration.
3. Configure your application server security domain, create an empty database, and deploy your application.
4. Log into your application at localhost:8080/<projectName> with your bootstrap credentials and begin using the no-code application.

Detailed instructions are available in the Skyve Readme at [github.com/skyvers/skyve](https://github.com/skyvers/skyve).
