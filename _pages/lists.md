## Lists and models

The Skyve list capability is core to most Skyve applications, and while much of the behaviour is usually implicit (just presenting a list of bean tuples from the database), Skyve allows overriding and customisation of the feature.

This is particularly useful where a developer needs to drive a list or tree from non-database data, or to customise the way filtering or summary features work.

The treeGrid feature (see <a href="https://skyvers.github.io/skyve-dev-guide/hierarchies/">Hierarchies</a>) is a special case of the list feature, where a filter is applied to return only nodes with a designated parent (representing that part of the tree), and therefore treeGrids can be customised in the same way as listGrids.

Some situations where a developer may want to consider customising the feature:
* showing a list of files or folders from the file system
* listing content items from the content repository
* driving tree grids to use non-database driven hierarchies
* querying a web API
* using a non-SQL datasource
* showing an email list from the SMTP server
* changing the way the `<filterParameter>` works for a `listGrid`

### Example reference list models

The Skyve admin module contains several use-cases of ListModel implementations which are useful for developers to review:

Model | Description
-------|---------
DataMaintenance.BackupsModel | lists items from the file system using the list feature 
DataMaintenance.ContentModel | lists items from the content repository using the list feature
Communication.BatchesModel  | *this is a basic variant of the DataMaintenance.BackupsModel*

### Declaring a list model

A list model is a Java class that extends `org.skyve.metadata.view.model.list.ListModel<>()` and located in the models subpackage (as shown below):

!["Model location"](./../assets/images/lists/model-location.png "Model location")

Skyve lists and models rely on a number of key concepts:

Concept | Description
--------|-----------
Driving Document | The primary document being listed - the document that will be navigated to if the user zooms into a row in the list
Projection | data fields returned or contained by the list concept, but not necessarily displayed as a column
Column | data fields which are shown to the user in the list
Parameter | a value and binding pair passed to the list - usually for the purposes of constructing a filter
Filter | a set of criteria limiting what data is returned by the list 
Detail Query | the way of retrieving the rows shown in the list
Summary Query | the way of retrieving the summary totals shown in the list summary
Page | a Class that represents a list of rows with a size and summary

#### Key methods

Method | Description
-------|------------
`fetch()` | returns a `Page` of results to be displayed in the `listGrid`
`iterate()` | enables export of a row using the export features of the `listGrid`

The general approach for creating a simple list model is:
* In the constructor, set the drivingDocument, projections and columns - this might be done for special cases of query-based models by specifying or establishing the query on which the list will be based
* Implement the `fetch()` method to return a `Page` of results for display.

#### Special case list models

ListModel | Description/comments
----------|--------------
`DocumentQueryListModel` | this approach takes advantage of the inbuilt handling of `DocumentQuery` and allows the developer to customise or construct the `DocumentQuery` and filters with minimal effort (rather than specifying the `DrivingDocument`, `Projections`, `Columns` and a `fetch()` method)
`InMemoryListModel` | intended to provide a basis for complete implementation of all listGrid functions - advanced filtering, tags, flags, snapshot, summary etc.
